# mass-chatbot
A chatbot that can be used to automate talking to multiple users at once, for whatever purpose (not my business).

## Installing
Assuming you have Python and git bash installed.
Run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/ezrael-git/mass-chatbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
Configuration is completely up to you. I'm assuming you have prior Python knowledge so just go over the code to edit chatbot behavior.

To run the script just use the following commands
```
cd mass-chatbot/src
py main.py
```

Cheers.
